# Daniel Kartin
Software Developer, dabbling in software architecture

## About me
I am a 27 year old software developer focusing on the front end, with a special eye for the good user experience. I have over 5 years of experience with building software, both in the front end and the back end. I put quality at the forefront of everything I do.

In my work I have come across many different technologies, upon which I've sought to increase business value. These span from setting up build and test pipelines in Azure DevOps, to designing user facing user interfaces in penpot, and remotely accessing Linux servers to troubleshoot deployments. Being confronted with new challenges is what really keeps me going, and is something I excel at tackling.

Working in team-based setups is where I thrive, and where I believe you learn the best. Having teammates to bounce ideas off of, or asking for help with a particular problem is always faster than throwing yourself at it for multiple days with no luck, I find. I always attempt to bring a good attitude into everything I do, including any cross-team work, or in contact with stakeholders.
